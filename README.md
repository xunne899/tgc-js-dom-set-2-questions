# tgc-js-dom-practise-set-2

There are three sets of practises here!

The **basic set** are simple hands-on to demonstrate certain principles, while the **practise_set** are those that ask you to solve specific
problems using a specific technique. Finally we have the **challenge** sets which will require you to combine different techniques together.

## Instructions

1. Each folder is one question

2. If there isn't a `script.js` file provided, create your own

3. If there is a `script.template.js`, **duplicate** it and rename it as `script.js`

4. Uncomment the `<script>` tag in the `index.html` if necessarily.

4. To test, type `npm test xxx` where `xxx` is the first three alphabets of the question folder.
